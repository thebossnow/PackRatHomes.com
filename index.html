    <p>At Pack Rat Homes, our core services focus on compassionate cleanup, where we carefully clear clutter, restore homes to safe and functional states, and handle everything from light decluttering to comprehensive waste removal. We approach each project with empathy, adapting to your pace and preferences to minimize stress while ensuring thorough sanitization and organization, making spaces move-in ready or prepared for your next steps. No matter the scale—big overhauls or small jobs—we prioritize your needs, offering flexible options to dispose of unwanted items responsibly. For those interested, we provide optional real estate insights to explore selling or transitioning the home.</p>
